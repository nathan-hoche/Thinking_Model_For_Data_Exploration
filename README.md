# Thinking model for Data Exploration and Visualization ðŸ“Š

## Introduction

This project is a simple example on how to use a thinking model to explore and visualize data. The goal is to provide a structured approach to understanding data through exploration, analysis, and visualization.

## Usage

To use this project, you will first need to install the required packages. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you will have to download the dataset (exposed on `Kaggle`) via the `download_data.py` script. This script will download the dataset from the provided URL and save it. You can run it with:

```bash
python utils/download_dataset.py
```

Then, you can run the main script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py [-h] --datapath DATAPATH [--model MODEL] [--verbose VERBOSE]

```

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --datapath DATAPATH  Path to the data (required).
  --model MODEL        Name or path of the model (optional).
  --verbose VERBOSE    Visualise LLM streaming response



> [!NOTE]
> The datapath is displayed at the end of the download script, so you can copy it and paste it in the command line.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use a different model, you can specify it with the `--model` option. The default model is `qwen3:0.6b`, which is a lightweight model that works well for this task. You can also change the dataset path with the `--datapath` option.

> [!WARNING]
> It's possible that the model is not pulled on your local machine, so you will have to run the following command to pull it: `ollama pull qwen3:0.6b`

## Explanation

For this project, I used the `Qwen3:0.6B` model, using `Ollama` for the inference. The model is designed to help you think about data exploration and visualization in a structured way.

This project will generate a very basic summary of the data, containing the following sections:
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset; based on the file name and the different column names
- **Proposed Studies**: A list of potential studies that can be conducted with the dataset, including a brief description of each study.
- **Visualization**: A step-by-step approach to visualize the data using Python libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

> You can view the generated summaries in the `docs` folder. ![Example 1](docs/Basic_Stats.csv.md) & ![Example 2](docs/Career_Stats_Defensive.csv.md)


> [!NOTE]
> This is a very fast and simple project, a lot of improvements can be made!
